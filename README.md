Here's the updated README to reflect that the script is specifically for adding EMC values to items:

# Project EMC Value Generator

## Description
A Python script that adds EMC values to items in Minecraft's Project E based on log entries. It generates a structured JSON file to populate those values automatically.

## Features
- Adds EMC values to items based on entries in the log file.
- Customizable default EMC values for items.
- Outputs results in a structured JSON format compatible with Project E.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x installed on your machine.

## Usage
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/project-emc-value-generator.git
   cd project-emc-value-generator
   ```

2. **Place Your Log File**:
   Ensure your log file is named `Missing EMC.txt` and is in the same directory as the script. You can change the file name, but you'll need to update the script accordingly.

3. **Run the Script**:
   ```bash
   python generate_emc.py
   ```

4. **Check Output**:
   The script will create a `custom_emc_formatted.json` file containing the generated EMC values.

## Customization
- You can modify the default EMC value in the script if needed.
